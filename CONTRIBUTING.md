# Branching Strategy

## How to contribute
When you are working on a new feature : create a new branch with the feature's name
Once the code is done and stable, merge with the main branch
The main branch will be use to correct all bugs due to the merge.
One the main branch is stable too : we can finally push on the release branch. All Week tags will be on the release branch.
